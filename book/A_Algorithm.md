An air of excitement filled the
Italian town of Bologna on the 12th
of February, 1535, with mathematicians, nimble number experts and
lovers of contests of all kinds flocking to it from all over Italy and
even some other countries of Medieval Europe. The occasion was the
opening of a mathematical tournament, one of the features of which
was, it had been announced, a challenge by a mathematician by the
name of Fiore to compete with him
in the art of solving cubic equations.
The one who solved the greater number of problems put forward by the
other would be declared the winner.

Fiore’s challenge was accepted by
one Niccolo Tartaglia, an obscure
teacher of mathematics. He won the
contest, having solved all the 30
problems offered him by Fiore &mdash; who
was unable to solve a single one of
Tartaglia’s!

How was Niccolo Tartaglia able
to gain such a brilliant victory,
which left none in doubt as to who
was the better man? The answer to
this question is to be found in events
that preceded the tournament.

Ten years or so earlier Scipio del
Ferro, professor of mathematics at
the university of Bologna, had died.
Shortly before his death he had discovered a general method of solving
an extremely difficult problem, thus
crowning the work of many years.
The only person he had informed of
this had been Anabello della Nove,
his son-in-law and successor at the
university. By some devious ways,
however, the secret reached Fiore.
With a rule for solving a problem
which had defied the Arabs, Greeks,
and scholars of Medieval Europe in
his hands, Fiore decided that he
could challenge the mathematicians
of the world.

His hopes, however, were dashed
when Tartaglia responded to his challenge. Tartaglia, a mathematical genius, was confident that he would
easily beat Fiore, but ten days before the contest he learned that Fiore
was in possession of the late Scipio
Ferro’s method. Undaunted, Tartaglia got down to work and within those
few days came up with a better method which enabled him to triumph brilliantly at the contest.

Tartaglia’s algorithm, later perfected by the Italian mathematician
Girolamo Cardano, survives to this
day as a general solution of cubic
equations.

## So what is an algorithm? What is this universal too! for solving problems?

The simplest mathematical operation is addition. It can be carried out without
any understanding of how it works, simply by obeying certain rules best exemplified by the use of the abacus:

“Move to the right the number of beads corresponding to the number of units
of the first figure. Then move to the right the number of beads equal to the number of units of the second figure. Count the total number of beads for the requisite sum.”

Using these rules a first-former at school can add one-digit numbers with the
help of an abacus. Only in mathematics instead of “rule” they say “algorithm”.
If a problem is likened to a lock, then the algorithm for its solution is the key.

Algorithms are needed to solve diverse problems. Mathematics cannot get
along without a technology of its own&mdash;a technology of problem-solving.
