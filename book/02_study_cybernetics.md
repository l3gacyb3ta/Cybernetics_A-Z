## Study Cybernetics

Our century may be termed the century of cybernetics. Today science, technology, industry can hardly be imagined without electronic computers, without
automata, without new methods which science of control and regulation places
at the disposal of man.

The electronic machines grow in number from day to day. They are, indeed,
indispensable tools for man’s intellectual work. They help us to cognize nature,
to control it. Each new machine made to help man contains the thought of the
scientist, the talent of the designer, th skill of the worker. Yesterday clever
machines were the fabulous creation of man, today they belong to everyday reality. No matter where you go &ndash; to the institute, to the factory, to the office &ndash;
everywhere you are bound to meet machines helping man in his work, which demands not physical but mental exertions. Machines control automatic plants,
pilot space vehicles, ontrol road traffic, carry out mathematical computations,
make diagnoses, draw up plans, teach, account, calculate. It’s no small burden that our electronic helpers have been made to shoulder!

It’s up to you, young men, not just to master this sophisticated technology
but to design and build new, even more advanced machines, develop the science
which governs them, dig into unknown strata of cyhernetic knowledge.

Many are the wonderful and interesting exploits that await you. But they’ll
need a lot of knowledge and skill. And to attain knowledge and skill one should
study long and hard.

I would like to remind you of the words of V. I. Lenin: “Study, study and
study!”

Wide and deep is their meaning: you should not only study, but should always be
“on the cutting edge” of advanced knowledge, be abreast of the time, see far ahead of you.

Only the competent are able to master science. If you want to rule over clever
machines, to build electronic robots, to blaze new trails in cybernetics you should
study the fundamentals of the science of cybernetics, should take hold of the
treasures of knowledge collected for you by men of former generations, by your
fathers and grandfathers.

Half a century spent in the cause of science gives me the right to say some words
to you.

Firstly, I would wish you to study cybernetics. Look, even a small encyclopaedia on cybernetics contains a wealth of treasures discovered by the intellect
of man. How much greater are the riches of full-scale science, of its vast domains!

So this is my advice: develop your knowledge of cybernetics.

Secondly, I would like you to love the perfect creation of man—the electronic
computer. These good helpers of man haven’t yet had their last word. Perhaps,
some of you will be able to make them reveal their new possibilities heretofore
unknown.

So learn about the electronic computer, about its history, gain skills in electronics, dream about future electronic computers.

My third wish is: remember, there’s top and bottom in every job. It is enti-
cing to be able to make one leap to the top and, having once reached it, view the
boundless expanses around you. But don’t forget: everything new, exciting,
dazzling, if only it’s the real thing, is always deeply rooted. Therefore, the know-
ledge of the fundamentals is an absolute must. There’s nothing so dangerous in
science (and in technology as well) as superficiality.

So, study fundamentals and do not forget that mathematics, information theory, physics, electronics, metallography and many other sciences are the building
stones of which the foundation of the building of modern knowledge, modern
technology has been built.

And lastly. Every job profits from enthusiasm, from purposefulness, from the
ability to sort out the principal. Can these be attained without love for the subject, without fidelity to it?

Time will pass, and, may be, you will remember the “letter” of this cybernetics encyclopaedia which prompted you to enter full-scale science or the world
of exciting technology.

A happy journey to you all, cybernetic scientists, programmists, operators to be. All the best to you!
